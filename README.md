## MergeSort.m

This code implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order using recursion and merging.

### How Merge Sort Works:

Recursive Splitting:

The mergeSort function splits the array into two halves until each part has one or zero elements (base case).

Merging:

The merge function then combines the sorted halves into a single sorted array by comparing elements one by one.
